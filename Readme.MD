Thank you for checking out my data analyst portfolio

1. The analysis and visualizations in this repo highlight my data analysis journey starting with Power BI, Tableau and Power Point with a gradual progression to data science tools R and Python.
2. All analysis start with Excel or SQL
3. The portfolio is presented using Github (Gitpages), HTML and CSS which I have also learnt along the way
