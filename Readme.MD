Thank you for checking out my data analyst portfolio

The analysis and visualizations in this repo highlight my data analysis journey starting with Power BI and Power Point with a gradual progression to data science tools R and Python
The portfolio is presented using Github (Gitpages), HTML and CSS which I have also learnt along the way
